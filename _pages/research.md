## Working Papers

[**Climate Change in Developing Countries: Global Warming Effects, Transmission Channels and Adaptation Policies**](https://publications.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/medias/documents/wp822_0.pdf), *Banque de France Working Paper 822*, with [Olivier de Bandt](https://www.banque-france.fr/en/economics/economists-and-researchers/olivier-de-bandt) and [Luc Jacolin](https://www.banque-france.fr/en/economie/economistes-et-chercheurs/luc-jacolin) (July 2021).

**Abstract**: Using panel data covering 126 low-and middle-income countries over 1960-2017, we find that sustained positive temperature deviations from their historical norms have a non-linear negative effect on economic growth and growth per capita. A sustained 1°C temperature increase lowers real GDP per capita annual growth by 0.74–1.52 percentage points, irrespective of levels of development. We also find that temperature rise affects the households’ intertemporal trade-off between consumption and investment, since the share of private consumption in total value-added increases while the share of investment declines. A sectoral decomposition shows that the share of industrial value-added also declines. While the share of agricultural value-added increases, agricultural output and productivity declines. Taken together, our results suggest that global warming will reinforce development traps, hindering further adaptation to climate change, particularly in the countries with the lowest levels of income given their lower resilience and higher socioeconomic vulnerability.

[**Civil Conflicts and Exchange Rate Misalignment: Evidence from MENA and Arab League Members**](https://erf.org.eg/publications/civil-conflicts-and-exchange-rate-misalignment-evidence-from-mena-and-arab-league-members-2/), *ERF Working Paper No. 1495*, (October 2021).

**Abstract**: For more than a decade, civil conflicts intensity has been high in the Middle East and North Africa, yet the monetary and financial impacts of such episodes have received relatively little attention. Using macroeconomic and conflict panel data for Arab League members, Iran and Turkey during the period 1970–2018, this paper constructs a country-specific real exchange rate misalignment index and adopts an instrumental variable approach to show that civil conflicts lead to real exchange rate overvaluations in the region: a 1 unit increase in civil conflict intensity leads to a 0.24 unit increase in the RER misalignment index. Economic policy during post-conflict transitions should be elaborated based on a strategy to realign the currency in order to prevent further macroeconomic imbalances and foster social stability, economic growth and long-term development.

[**Fiscal Consolidations and Informality in Latin America and the Caribbean**](https://ideas.repec.org/p/mse/cesdoc/20004.html), *Documents de travail du Centre d'Économie de la Sorbonne 2020.04* (January 2020).

**Abstract**: The transmission mechanisms of fiscal policy are significantly affected by informality in the labour market. Extending a narrative database of fiscal consolidations in 14 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean between 1989 and 2016 in order to account for heterogeneity in terms of commitment to the reforms, I show that tax-based and spending-based multipliers are both recessionary and do not significantly differ one from another in this region. Furthermore, these multipliers decline in absolute value as the level of labour informality increases in the economy, although evidences are less robust for spending-based consolidations. An analysis of the effects of tax-based consolidations on private demand suggests that labour market informality constitutes a short-term social buffer that attenuates the contractionary effects of this type of policy by increasing investment opportunities through tax evasion and entrepreneurial alternatives to unemployment for dismissed workers 

**Keywords**: Fiscal consolidation, taxation, informality, emerging market economies.

[**Power Sector Reforms and Technological Change: Evidence from Arab League Members**](https://erf.org.eg/publications/power-sector-reforms-and-technological-change-evidence-from-arab-league-members-2/), *ERF Working Paper No. 1423*, with [Dina Ragab](https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=dinaragab/) (November 2020).

**Abstract**: Power sector reforms have been widely adopted in the turn of the 21st Century, including in the Middle East and North Africa. Have the promises that accompany such reforms led to technological change in the region? Adopting an instrumental variable approach and using an index of power sector reforms and aggregate macroeconomic data for 18 Arab League member states between 1982 and 2013, we provide robust evidence that there is a positive causal relationship between power sector reforms and technological change, proxied by high-tech exports, in Arab countries. While the literature has evidenced a relationship between such reforms and economic growth, our results suggest that technological change is a transmission channel of this relationship.

[**Phillips in A Revolution: Unemployment and Prices in Early 21st Century Egypt**](https://erf.org.eg/publications/phillips-in-a-revolution-unemployment-and-prices-in-early-21st-century-egypt-2/), *ERF Working Paper No. 1453* (December 2020).

**Abstract**: The relative price Phillips curve hypothesis gives a better account of the dynamics of the Egyptian economy than the price Phillips curve. Using standard aggregate macroeconomic quarterly data for the Egyptian economy from 2003q1 to 2019q1 to obtain Ordinary Least Squares and Generalized Method of Moments estimates for four versions of the Phillips curve, this article provides evidence that the exchange rate regime affects the relation between prices and unemployment in emerging economies: while an economic boom leads to lower unemployment and higher inflation in a fixed exchange rate regime, the nominal appreciation of the currency negatively affects imported goods prices and flattens the price Phillips curve in a flexible exchange rate regime. The results also suggest a broken link between inflation and unemployment during the Egyptian Revolution and the subsequent period, raising questions on macroeconomic management in times of political turmoil.

**Keywords**: Phillips Curve, Egyptian Economy, Labour Market, Monetary Policy, Small Open Economy.
