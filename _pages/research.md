## Working Papers

[Fiscal Consolidations and Informality in Latin America and the Caribbean](https://ideas.repec.org/p/mse/cesdoc/20004.html), (January 2020).

**Abstract**: The transmission mechanisms of fiscal policy are significantly affected by informality in the labour market. Extending a narrative database of fiscal consolidations in 14 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean between 1989 and 2016 in order to account for heterogeneity in terms of commitment to the reforms, I show that tax-based and spending-based multipliers are both recessionary and do not significantly differ one from another in this region. Furthermore, these multipliers decline in absolute value as the level of labour informality increases in the economy, although evidences are less robust for spending-based consolidations. An analysis of the effects of tax-based consolidations on private demand suggests that labour market informality constitutes a short-term social buffer that attenuates the contractionary effects of this type of policy by increasing investment opportunities through tax evasion and entrepreneurial alternatives to unemployment for dismissed workers 

**Keywords**: Fiscal consolidation, taxation, informality, emerging market economies.

[Power Sector Reforms and Technological Change: Evidence from Arab League Members](https://erf.org.eg/publications/power-sector-reforms-and-technological-change-evidence-from-arab-league-members-2/), with [Dina Ragab](https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=dinaragab/) (November 2020).

**Abstract**: Power sector reforms have been widely adopted in the turn of the 21st Century, including in the Middle East and North Africa. Have the promises that accompany such reforms led to technological change in the region? Adopting an instrumental variable approach and using an index of power sector reforms and aggregate macroeconomic data for 18 Arab League member states between 1982 and 2013, we provide robust evidence that there is a positive causal relationship between power sector reforms and technological change, proxied by high-tech exports, in Arab countries. While the literature has evidenced a relationship between such reforms and economic growth, our results suggest that technological change is a transmission channel of this relationship.

**Keywords**: Power Sector Reforms, Industrialization, Technological Change, Arab Countries.
