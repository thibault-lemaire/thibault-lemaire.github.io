**Welcome to my website!**  

I recently obtained my PhD in Economics from University Paris 1 Panthéon – Sorbonne and worked as a Research Fellow at Banque de France conducting research on the macroeconomic effects of climate change in developing countries. I hold a master’s degree in development economics from University Paris 1 Panthéon – Sorbonne and a bachelor’s degree in economics from Toulouse School of Economics.  

I have extensive experience living, studying and working in developing countries, including Peru (Universidad del Pacífico), Egypt (Cairo University - جامعة القاهرة), Colombia (Universidad de los Andes), Guatemala (Ministry of Economics) and Panama (French Treasury and embassy). My research interests include monetary and fiscal policy, open macroeconomics, informality, economics of climate change and developing countries.
